DiabetesInsipidus: An Update.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32741486/,"The differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus involves the distinction between central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. Differentiation is important because treatment strategies vary; the wrong treatment can be dangerous. Reliable differentiation is difficult especially in patients with primary polydipsia or partial forms of diabetes insipidus. New diagnostic algorithms are based on the measurement of copeptin after osmotic stimulation by hypertonic saline infusion or after nonosmotic stimulation by arginine and have a higher diagnostic accuracy than the water deprivation test. Treatment involves correcting preexisting water deficits, but is different for central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and primary polydipsia."
Diagnosis and Management of CentralDiabetesInsipidusin Adults.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35771962/,"Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a clinical syndrome which results from loss or impaired function of vasopressinergic neurons in the hypothalamus/posterior pituitary, resulting in impaired synthesis and/or secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). AVP deficiency leads to the inability to concentrate urine and excessive renal water losses, resulting in a clinical syndrome of hypotonic polyuria with compensatory thirst. CDI is caused by diverse etiologies, although it typically develops due to neoplastic, traumatic, or autoimmune destruction of AVP-synthesizing/secreting neurons. This review focuses on the diagnosis and management of CDI, providing insights into the physiological disturbances underpinning the syndrome. Recent developments in diagnostic techniques, particularly the development of the copeptin assay, have improved accuracy and acceptability of the diagnostic approach to the hypotonic polyuria syndrome. We discuss the management of CDI with particular emphasis on management of fluid intake and pharmacological replacement of AVP. Specific clinical syndromes such as adipsic diabetes insipidus and diabetes insipidus in pregnancy as well as management of the perioperative patient with diabetes insipidus are also discussed."
Diabetesinsipidus: diagnosis andtreatmentof a complex disease.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16444918/,"Diabetes insipidus, characterized by excretion of copious volumes of dilute urine, can be life-threatening if not properly diagnosed and managed. It can be caused by two fundamentally different defects: inadequate or impaired secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland (neurogenic or central diabetes insipidus) or impaired or insufficient renal response to ADH (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). The distinction is essential for effective treatment."
Diagnosis and management ofdiabetesinsipidusfor the internist: an update.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33713498/,"Diabetes insipidus is a disorder characterized by excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine. Four entities have to be differentiated: central diabetes insipidus resulting from a deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus resulting from resistance to AVP in the kidneys, gestational diabetes insipidus resulting from an increase in placental vasopressinase and finally primary polydipsia, which involves excessive intake of large amounts of water despite normal AVP secretion and action. Distinguishing between the different types of diabetes insipidus can be challenging. A detailed medical history, physical examination and imaging studies are needed to detect the aetiology of diabetes insipidus. Differentiation between the various forms of hypotonic polyuria is then done by the classical water deprivation test or the more recently developed hypertonic saline or arginine stimulation together with copeptin (or AVP) measurement. In patients with idiopathic central DI, a close follow-up is needed since central DI can be the first sign of an underlying pathology. Treatment of diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia depends on the underlying aetiology and differs in central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. This review will discuss issues and newest developments in diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment, with a focus on central diabetes insipidus."
Diabetesinsipidusin infants and children.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27156767/,"Diabetes insipidus, the inability to concentrate urine resulting in polyuria and polydipsia, can have different manifestations and management considerations in infants and children compared to adults. Central diabetes insipidus, secondary to lack of vasopressin production, is more common in children than is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the inability to respond appropriately to vasopressin. The goal of treatment in both forms of diabetes insipidus is to decrease urine output and thirst while allowing for appropriate fluid balance, normonatremia and ensuring an acceptable quality of life for each patient. An infant's obligate need to consume calories as liquid and the need for readjustment of medication dosing in growing children both present unique challenges for diabetes insipidus management in the pediatric population. Treatment modalities typically include vasopressin or thiazide diuretics. Special consideration must be given when managing diabetes insipidus in the adipsic patient, post-surgical patient, and in those undergoing chemotherapy or receiving medications that alter free water clearance."
Nephrogenicdiabetesinsipidus: a comprehensive overview.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35146976/,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is characterized by the inability to concentrate urine that results in polyuria and polydipsia, despite having normal or elevated plasma concentrations of arginine vasopressin (AVP). In this study, we review the clinical aspects and diagnosis of NDI, the various etiologies, current treatment options and potential future developments. NDI has different clinical manifestations and approaches according to the etiology. Hereditary forms of NDI are mainly caused by mutations in the genes that encode key proteins in the AVP signaling pathway, while acquired causes are normally associated with specific drug exposure, especially lithium, and hydroelectrolytic disorders. Clinical manifestations of the disease vary according to the degree of dehydration and hyperosmolality, being worse when renal water losses cannot be properly compensated by fluid intake. Regarding the diagnosis of NDI, it is important to consider the symptoms of the patient and the diagnostic tests, including the water deprivation test and the baseline plasma copeptin measurement, a stable surrogate biomarker of AVP release. Without proper treatment, patients may developcomplications leading to high morbidity and mortality, such as severe dehydration and hypernatremia. In that sense, the treatment of NDI consists in decreasing the urine output, while allowing appropriate fluid balance, normonatremia, and ensuring an acceptable quality of life. Therefore, therapeutic options include nonpharmacological interventions, including sufficient water intake and a low-sodium diet, and pharmacological treatment. The main medications used for NDI are thiazide diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and amiloride, used isolated or in combination."
Adipsicdiabetesinsipidus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34238462/,"Adipsic diabetes insipidus (ADI) is a rare but devastating disorder of water balance with significant associated morbidity and mortality. Most patients develop the disease as a result of hypothalamic destruction from a variety of underlying etiologies. Damage to osmolar-responsive neuroreceptors, primarily within the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, results in impaired production and release of arginine vasopressin (AVP). Important regulating circuits of thirst sense and drive are regionally colocalized with AVP centers and therefore are also injured. Patients with central diabetes insipidus with impaired thirst response, defined as ADI, suffer from wide swings of plasma osmolality resulting in repeated hospitalization, numerous associated comorbidities, and significant mortality. Treatment recommendations are based largely on expert advice from case series owing to the rarity of disease prevalence. Acute disease management focuses on fixed dosing of antidiuretic hormone analogues and calculated prescriptions of obligate daily water intake. Long-term care requires patient/family education, frequent reassessment of clinical and biochemical parameters, as well as screening and treatment of comorbidities."
History ofDiabetesInsipidus.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26913870/,"Under physiological conditions, fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis is maintained by the kidney adjusting urine volume and composition according to body needs. Diabetes Insipidus is a complex and heterogeneous clinical syndrome affecting water balance and characterized by constant diuresis, resulting in large volumes of dilute urine. With respect to the similarly named Diabetes Mellitus, a disease already known in ancient Egypt, Greece and Asia, Diabetes Insipidus has been described several thousand years later. In 1670s Thomas Willis, noted the difference in taste of urine from polyuric subjects compared with healthy individuals and started the differentiation of Diabetes Mellitus from the more rare entity of Diabetes Insipidus. In 1794, Johann Peter Frank described polyuric patients excreting nonsaccharine urine and introduced the term of Diabetes Insipidus. An hystorical milestone was the in 1913, when Farini successfully used posterior pituitary extracts to treat Diabetes Insipidus. Until 1920s the available evidence indicated Diabetes Insipidus as a disorder of the pituitary gland. In the early 1928, De Lange first observed that some patients with Diabetes Insipidus did not respond to posterior pituitary extracts and subsequently Forssman and Waring in 1945 established that the kidney had a critical role for these forms of Diabetes Insipidus resistant to this treatment. In 1947 Williams and Henry introduced the term Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus for the congenital syndrome characterized by polyuria and renal concentrating defect resistant to vasopressin. In 1955, du Vigneaud received the 1955 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the first synthesis of the hormone vasopressin representing a milestone for the treatment of Central Diabetes Insipidus."
Diabetesinsipidus--diagnosis and management.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22433947/,"Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is the end result of a number of conditions that affect the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal system. The known causes include germinoma/craniopharyngioma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), local inflammatory, autoimmune or vascular diseases, trauma resulting from surgery or an accident, sarcoidosis, metastases and midline cerebral and cranial malformations. In rare cases, the underlying cause can be genetic defects in vasopressin synthesis that are inherited as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive traits. The diagnosis of the underlying condition is challenging and raises several concerns for patients and parents as it requires long-term follow-up. Proper etiological diagnosis can be achieved via a series of steps that start with clinical observations and then progress to more sophisticated tools. Specifically, MRI identification of pituitary hyperintensity in the posterior part of the sella, now considered a clear marker of neurohypophyseal functional integrity, together with the careful analysis of pituitary stalk shape and size, have provided the most striking findings contributing to the diagnosis and understanding of some forms of 'idiopathic' CDI. MRI STIR (short-inversion-time inversion recovery sequencing) is a promising technology for the early identification of LCH-dependent CDI."
Diabetesinsipidus: Vasopressin deficiency.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38316255/,"Diabetes insipidus is a disorder characterized by hypo-osmotic polyuria secondary to abnormal synthesis, regulation, or renal action of antidiuretic hormone. Recently, an expert group, with the support of patient associations, proposed that diabetes insipidus be renamed to avoid confusion with diabetes mellitus. The most common form of diabetes insipidus is secondary to a dysfunction of the neurohypophysis (central diabetes insipidus) and would be therefore named 'vasopressin deficiency'. The rarer form, which is linked to renal vasopressin resistance (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), would then be named 'vasopressin resistance'. The etiology of diabetes insipidus is sometimes clear, in the case of a neurohypophyseal cause (tumoral or infiltrative damage) or a renal origin, but in some cases diabetes insipidus can be difficult to distinguish from primary polydipsia, which is characterized by consumption of excessive quantities of water without any abnormality in regulation or action of antidiuretic hormone. Apart from patients' medical history, physical examination, and imaging of the hypothalamic-pituitary region, functional tests such as water deprivation or stimulation of copeptin by hyperosmolarity (induced by infusion of hypertonic saline) can be proposed in order to distinguish between these different etiologies. The treatment of diabetes insipidus depends on the underlying etiology, and in the case of a central etiology, is based on the administration of desmopressin which improves patient symptoms but does not always result in an optimal quality of life. The cause of this altered quality of life may be oxytocin deficiency, oxytocin being also secreted from the neurohypophysis, though this has not been fully established. The possibility of a new test using stimulation of oxytocin to identify alterations in oxytocin synthesis is of interest and would allow confirmation of a deficiency in those patients presenting with diabetes insipidus linked to neurohypophyseal dysfunction."
